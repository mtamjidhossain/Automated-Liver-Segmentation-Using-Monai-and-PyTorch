# Automated-Liver-Segmentation-Using-Monai-and-PyTorch
Deep learning can be used to detect diseases like cancer by finding tumor cells through medical images. Deep learning also has the potential to improve the quality of medical care by segmenting organs during surgery or scanning patients for signs of cancer or other ailments.  So the goal of this project is to use Monai and PyTorch with the Python programming language to create a deep learning model to segment a liver from a public CT scan dataset. We can use the same model that segments the liver, as well as use the same principle to segment other organs or tumors from CT scans or MRIs.

This project was learnt from the freecodecamp.org course "PyTorch and Monai for AI Healthcare Imaging" https://youtu.be/M3ZWfamWrBM by PhD student Mohammed El Amine MOKHTARI.
